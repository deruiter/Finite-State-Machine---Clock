# Finite-State-Machine---Clock
My -far from finished!- little clock project using a Finite State Machine

I urge Arduino toddlers (like me) to take a look at the AMZING Finite State Machine for coding their Arduino projects!

I am not used to programming but a Finite State Machine enables me to get structured code and it's very easy to maintain.
